They provide affordable housing options for a significant portion of the Singaporean population. HDB flats are sold under a lease system, and a robust secondary market exists for these flats. This resale market is crucial for stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and investors, who rely on accurate pricing to make informed decisions. As of now, the organization seeks to leverage data on HDB resale transactions to enhance decision-making processes and improve market efficiency. The dataset contains detailed transaction records from January 2017 to June 2024, including information on transaction month, town, flat type, storey range, and resale price.\n",

Stakeholders, including potential buyers, sellers, and investors, require reliable price estimates to make informed decisions in the housing market. Currently, price estimation relies heavily on market knowledge and simple comparative methods, which may not account for the complex interactions of various factors influencing resale prices. There is also a need for improved market segmentation to allow for more targeted marketing and sales strategies. This project aims to provide a more sophisticated, data-driven approach to predicting resale prices, thereby enhancing decision-making and market efficiency.\n",

        "#### 3. Data requirements\n",
        "A section to describe the data requirements. The requirements can be defined either on the meta-level or directly in the data, and should state the expected conditions of the data, i.e., whether a certain sample is plausible. The requirements can be, e.g., the expected feature values (a range for continuous features or a list for discrete features), the format of the data and the maximum number of missing values. The bounds of the requirements has to be defined carefully to include all possible real world values but discard non-plausible data. Data that does not satisfy the expected conditions could be treated as anomalies and need to be evaluated manually or excluded automatically. To mitigate the risk of anchoring bias in this first phase discussing the requirements with a domain expert is advised. Documentation of the data requirements could be expressed in the form of a schema with strict data types and conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ##### Example\n",
        "> - The data requirements for this project are defined as follows:\n",
        "> > - Customer Demographics: Age should be within the range of 18 to 100 years, and gender should be either male or female.\n",
        "> > - Purchase History: The number of purchases should be greater than or equal to 0, and the total amount spent should be greater than or equal to $0.\n",
        "> > - Product Preferences: The product preferences should be represented as a list of product IDs, and each product ID should be unique and within the range of 1 to 1000.\n",
        "> > - Here we define expectations to satisfy the data requirements.\n",

        "A section to verify and report the quality of the data. Examine the quality of the data, addressing questions such as:\n",
        "- Is the data complete (does it cover all the cases required)?\n",
        "- Is it correct, or does it contain errors and, if there are errors, how common are they?\n",
        "- Are there missing values in the data? If so, how are they represented, where do they occur, and how common are they?\n",
        "\n",
        "> ##### Example\n",
        "> - Completeness: The data is complete in the sense that it covers all the required cases. All customers have demographic information, and all purchases are recorded.\n",
        "> - Correctness: The data appears to be correct, with no obvious errors. However, a manual review of the data is recommended to ensure that there are no errors.\n",
        "> - Missing Values: There are no missing values in the data.\n",
        "> - Overall, the data quality is high, and the data is suitable for analysis and modeling. However, a manual review of the data is recommended to ensure that there are no errors or anomalies."
